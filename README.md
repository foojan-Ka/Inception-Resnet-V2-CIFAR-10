# Inception-Resnet-V2-CIFAR-10
In this project I used Inception Resnet V2 architecture to estimate the classes of fed images from CIFAR 10. The images that are considered as the inputs for Inception Resnet V2 convolutional neural network, shall go through some modifications and transformations to be acceptable.
