# Inception-Resnet-V2-CIFAR-10
In this project I used Inception-Resnet-V2 architecture to estimate the classes of fed images from CIFAR 10. The images that are considered as the inputs for Inception Resnet V2 convolutional neural network (CNN), shall go through some modifications and transformations to be acceptable. Inception-Resnet-V2 is a multilayer CNN that is trained on more than a million of Imagenet database. In the final section of the code, VGG19 pretrained model was used for conducting some classification estimations.
